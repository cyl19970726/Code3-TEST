# Feature Specification: Daily Todo Management Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "帮我实现一个 每日 todo 工具（支持添加/编辑/删除、标记完成、按日期分组、持久化存储）"

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my daily tasks with the ability to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, organized by date, so that I can track my daily productivity and never lose my task history.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens the todo tool, **When** user selects current date, **Then** all tasks for today are displayed grouped by completion status (pending and completed)
2. **Given** user clicks "Add Task" button, **When** user enters task description "Review code" and submits, **Then** new task appears in today's task list with pending status
3. **Given** user has a pending task "Buy groceries", **When** user clicks edit icon and changes description to "Buy groceries and milk", **Then** task description is updated and change is persisted
4. **Given** user has a task "Call dentist", **When** user clicks delete icon and confirms deletion, **Then** task is removed from the list permanently
5. **Given** user has a pending task "Submit report", **When** user checks the completion checkbox, **Then** task moves to completed section with timestamp and strike-through style
6. **Given** user has created tasks on October 9th and October 10th, **When** user switches between dates using date picker, **Then** only tasks for selected date are displayed
7. **Given** user added 5 tasks yesterday and 3 tasks today, **When** user closes and reopens the application, **Then** all tasks are preserved and displayed correctly under respective dates
8. **Given** user has completed task "Morning exercise" at 7:30 AM, **When** user views the task, **Then** completion time "7:30 AM" is shown next to the task
9. **Given** user wants to review past tasks, **When** user navigates to previous dates using calendar view, **Then** historical tasks are displayed with their original completion status
10. **Given** user has 0 tasks for today, **When** user views today's list, **Then** empty state message "No tasks for today. Add your first task!" is shown

### Edge Cases
- How to handle very long task descriptions (500+ characters)?
- What happens if storage quota is exceeded?
- How to handle timezone changes when viewing historical tasks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: System shall allow users to create new tasks with description text for any date
- **FR-2**: System shall validate task description is not empty (minimum 1 character)
- **FR-3**: System shall support task descriptions up to 500 characters maximum
- **FR-4**: System shall allow users to edit task descriptions for both pending and completed tasks (editing preserves completion status)
- **FR-5**: System shall allow users to delete tasks with confirmation prompt
- **FR-6**: System shall allow users to mark tasks as complete with single click/tap
- **FR-7**: System shall allow users to unmark completed tasks back to pending status
- **FR-8**: System shall record completion timestamp when task is marked complete
- **FR-9**: System shall organize tasks by date (day level granularity)
- **FR-10**: System shall display tasks grouped by completion status (pending, completed)
- **FR-11**: System shall provide date navigation to view tasks from different dates
- **FR-12**: System shall persist all tasks to browser local storage automatically (single-device, no cloud sync)
- **FR-13**: System shall load persisted tasks on application startup
- **FR-14**: System shall display current date as default view on application launch
- **FR-15**: System shall show empty state message when no tasks exist for selected date
- **FR-16**: System shall display completed tasks with visual distinction (strike-through text)
- **FR-17**: System shall sort pending tasks by creation time (newest first)
- **FR-18**: System shall sort completed tasks by completion time (newest first)
- **FR-19**: System shall assign unique identifier to each task for reliable updates and deletions
- **FR-20**: System shall be accessible only via web browser on desktop (out of scope: native mobile apps, cloud sync, multi-device support)
- **FR-21**: System shall enter read-only mode with error banner if local storage is corrupted or unavailable (all write operations disabled)
- **FR-22**: System shall detect and prevent multi-tab usage (show warning modal if app is opened in multiple tabs/windows, disable new tab)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Task creation operation shall complete within 100ms
- **NFR-2**: Task list rendering shall complete within 200ms for up to 100 tasks per day (no hard limit on tasks, but performance target set at 100)
- **NFR-3**: Storage operations (save/load) shall not block user interface
- **NFR-4**: System shall support at least 90 days of historical task data
- **NFR-5**: System shall handle gracefully if storage quota is exceeded (notify user and prevent new task creation)
- **NFR-6**: Application shall run in modern desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge latest 2 versions)
- **NFR-7**: System shall maintain data integrity even if application crashes during operation (atomic storage writes)
- **NFR-8**: System shall detect storage corruption or unavailability within 500ms of application startup

### Key Entities *(data model)*
- **Task**: id (UUID), description (string, 1-500 chars), completed (boolean), createdAt (ISO timestamp), completedAt (ISO timestamp | null), date (ISO date string YYYY-MM-DD)
- **DailyTaskList**: date (ISO date string), tasks (array of Task), pendingCount (integer), completedCount (integer)
- **UserPreferences**: lastViewedDate (ISO date string), sortOrder (string enum: newest-first | oldest-first)
- **StorageMetadata**: version (string), lastModified (ISO timestamp), totalTaskCount (integer), oldestTaskDate (ISO date string), newestTaskDate (ISO date string)

## Clarifications
*This section will be populated by /clarify command*

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: What happens if user tries to add empty task description? → A: System prevents submission and shows validation message "Task description cannot be empty"
- Q: Should deleted tasks be recoverable or permanently removed? → A: Permanently removed (no recycle bin for MVP)
- Q: How many historical days should be stored? → A: Minimum 90 days, no maximum limit unless storage constraint
- Q: Should tasks support priority levels or tags? → A: Not in MVP, focus on core CRUD operations first
- Q: What if user wants to move a task to different date? → A: Not in MVP, user can copy by creating new task on target date
- Q: Should users be allowed to edit the description of tasks that are already marked as completed? → A: Yes, allow editing completed tasks freely (updates description only, preserves completion status)
- Q: Should there be a maximum limit on the number of tasks a user can create per day? → A: No limit - user can create unlimited tasks per day
- Q: Is this tool intended for single-device use only, or should it support multi-device synchronization? → A: Single-device only, web platform only (no mobile apps, no cloud sync)
- Q: What should happen if browser local storage becomes corrupted or unavailable? → A: Show error message and prevent all operations (read-only mode with error banner)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent edits if the app is open in multiple browser tabs/windows? → A: Not supported - only single tab allowed (show warning if multiple tabs detected)
